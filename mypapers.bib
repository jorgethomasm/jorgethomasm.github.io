    ABSTRACT = {Die Tendenz in der Energiebereitstellung geht deutlich zu Multi-Erzeugeranlagen, die eine Integration regenerativer Energien ermöglichen. Da das Energieangebot regenerativer Energieträger allerdings nicht deckungsgleich zum Energiebedarf ist, ist die vorausschauende Speicherung von Wärme und Strom sowie die Einsatzplanung der verschiedenen Energieträger wie Wärmepumpe oder BHKW besonders wichtig. Unterstützung dabei bietet der in einem Verbundprojekt entwickelte Energiemanager dynOpt-En. Im praktischen Einsatz wurde er bereits an mehreren Liegenschaften erprobt.},

    ABSTRACT = {Every morning, water suppliers need to define their pump schedules for the next 24 h for drinking water production. Plans must be designed in such a way that drinking water is always available and the amount of unused drinking water pumped into the network is reduced. Therefore, operators must accurately estimate the next day’s water consumption profile. In real-life applications with standard consumption profiles, some expert system or vector autoregressive models are used. Still, in recent years, significant improvements for time series prediction have been achieved through special deep learning algorithms called long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. This paper investigates the applicability of LSTM models for water demand prediction and optimal pump control and compares LSTMs against other methods currently used by water suppliers. It is shown that LSTMs outperform other methods since they can easily integrate additional information like the day of the week or national holidays. Furthermore, the online- and transfer-learning capabilities of the LSTMs are investigated. It is shown that LSTMs only need a couple of days of training data to achieve reasonable results. As the focus of the paper is on the real-world application of LSTMs, data from two different water distribution plants are used for benchmarking. Finally, it is shown that the LSTMs significantly outperform the system currently in operation.},

    abstract = {As the world becomes more urban, the focus on energy reduction in buildings grows with aims to tackle climate change. Being heat demand a representative slice of the total load of any non-tropical building, this paper develops a practical and less invasive forecast method for Building Energy Managers within a control framework. Methodologically, after performing a Graphical Data Analysis of heat demand profiles from two dwellings and an industrial facility, terms of a General Additive Model are developed, combining this powerful machine learning technique, adaptiveness, and the convenience of an available online meteorological forecast. The algorithm was able to predict thermal energy usage of 75% of the test days with an error below 25%, disregarding profile type and looking always at the next 48 hours. Also, results showed that the true added value of ambient temperature as exogenous and explanatory variable comes with its daily aggregation.},

@conference{Thomas2018,
    abstract = {Since arbitrarily oriented solar panels are every-where, the present work develops an algorithm to estimate the on-site turbidity variation in order to optimise the clear sky photovoltaic forecast, using past power records produced in presence of the isotropic diffuse irradiance component during absence of clouds when the generator is under full load; these data are considered as training datasets. The algorithm is based on Ineichen-Perez's solar resource and separation model, where turbidity factors are treated as optimisation parameters and different diffuse transposition models are swept, selecting the one that works best for the site. Reductions of the RMSEs between forecasted and real daily AC powers were on average above 70%, dramatically enhancing the clear sky photovoltaic energy prediction. Concerning solar resource irradiance components, the average diffuse fraction of 12 different validation datasets was reduced from an unrealistic 0.517 with the initial turbidity factors extracted from the solar radiation data website (SoDa), to a reasonable 0.224 with the new ones tuned. Moreover, the seasonality of turbidity can be measured using Photovoltaics. Whether the tuned factors represent near real on-site aerosols measurements or not is still to be determined.},

    abstract = {Energy storage systems coupled to solar photovoltaic arrays will become a vital pillar in the future energy landscape, both on and off the grid. The high variability of solar power can be overcome with smart technologies and rapid battery response rates. Knowledge of the prevalence (how often they occur) and persistence (how long they last) of photovoltaic power fluctuations allows storage system developers to find the optimal solution to achieve the desired level of smoothness in the resulting power output from the system. In this work power data measured at 1 Hz from the densely clustered arrays of the KIT 1 MWp solar installation are analysed using statistical techniques in order to characterise the variability of single arrays as well as that of the system as a whole. The relationship between correlation and distance is examined in detail using models from the literature, for fluctuation lengths in the range of several seconds and separation distances down to 10 metres. The smoothing that results from decorrelation can be used as an additional mitigation factor in the design of small-scale collections of solar systems, especially in the context of residential and district storage solutions.},
