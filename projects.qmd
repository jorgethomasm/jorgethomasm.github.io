## Machine Learning
It is known that the most common type of dataset found in the industry is the **tabular** one.

### Supervised Learning:
#### [Multivariate Regression with Visual Analytics](https://jorgethomasm.github.io/Ames-house-prices-prediction/HousePrices.html){target="_blank"}
In this classic Kaggle project you will see my workflow developing pipelines on the ETL phase of the DS cycle, as well as a tidy approach on the exploratory data analysis substantialy supported on Visual Analytics.

### Unsupervised Learning:
#### Clustering daily load profiles on time-series data
## Deep Learning
For datasets with high signal-to-noise ratio like image recognition and language translation, DL methods are the best.
