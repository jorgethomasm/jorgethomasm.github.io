I subscribe to Johnny Cash‚Äôs definition of paradise:\n‚ÄúThis morning, with her, having coffee.‚Äù\nProfessionally I am an Electrical Engineer fond of sustainable energy sources, in consequence data and modelling. Somehow, I‚Äôve always manage to end up doing what I love the most: the development of data-driven algorithms either for supporting control systems or providing business intelligence.\nI live in Karlsruhe. If you want to know how I got into what today is Data Science click on the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù tab. If you want to talk about data science, music or coffee instead, just drop me an email.\nHave a nice day or night.\nJ. Thomas"

Load and demand sequential data are a strong function of calendar facotors like hour and day type. Based on a famous proceeding with more than forty citations in patents, I developed this heriarchical clustering algorithm as a tool to identify the most relevant daily patterns, e.g., weekends, holidays, workdays and anomalous profiles."
