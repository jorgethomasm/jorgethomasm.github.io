# "Hello there"

Hi, I'm Jorge and I like espresso made with light roast beans. I subscribe to Johnny Cash's definition of paradise:

&emsp; – *“This morning, with her, having coffee.”*

Professionally I am an Electrical Engineer fond of sustainable energy sources, in consequence data and modelling. 
Somehow, I've always manage to end up doing what I love the most: the development of data-driven algorithms either for providing business intelligence or supporting control systems.

I live in Karlsruhe but I don't bike. If you want to know how I got into what today is Data Science click on the "About" tab. If you want to talk about data science, music or coffee instead, just drop me an [email](mailto:jorgethomasm@ieee.org).

Have a nice day or evening.

*J. Thomas*
