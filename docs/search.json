I subscribe to Johnny Cash‚Äôs definition of paradise:\n‚ÄÉ ‚Äì This morning, with her, having coffee.\nProfessionally I am an Electrical Engineer fond of sustainable energy sources; that means uncertainty, you know weather, and modelling. Somehow, I‚Äôve always manage to end up doing what I love the most: the development of data-driven algorithms either for providing business intelligence or supporting control systems.\nI don‚Äôt bike but I live in Karlsruhe. If you want to know how I got into what today is Data Science click on the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù tab. If you want to talk about data science, music or coffee instead, just drop me an email.\nHave a nice day or evening.\nJ. Thomas"
