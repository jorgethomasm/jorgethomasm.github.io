# Supervised Learning

## Machine Learning
### [Advanced Regression Techniques with Visual Analytics](https://jorgethomasm.github.io/Ames-house-prices-prediction/HousePrices.html){target="_blank"}
In this classic Kaggle project you can **follow my workflow** where I'll give you some tips along the way, developing pipelines on the ETL phase of the DS cycle, as well as a tidy approach on the exploratory data analysis substantialy supported on visual analytics.

## Deep Learning
It is known that the most common type of dataset found in the industry is the **tabular** one. In this regard ML's non-parametric methods with ensembling via bagging or boosting are king.

However, for datasets with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) like image recognition and language translation, DL methods are the best.

## Survival Analysis
My professional entry point to what at that time was *Data Mining*, specifically in the area of reliability and risk assessment of power networks.


# Unsupervised Learning
Discovering patterns in the feature space.

Very often we have to do some previoius ML for ML. Yes, that means performing some auto-labelling or at least identifying some possible ones.

## Machine Learning:
### [Hierarchical clustering of daily load profiles](https://github.com/jorgethomasm/HOME-Timeseries_Clustering_of_Daily_Profiles/wiki#which-daily-heat-demand-pattern-shape-belongs-to-which-mean-daily-ambient-temperature){target="_blank"}

In the modern world of sector-coupled utilities, i.e., gas, water, heat & power distribution, time-series always follow a very strong daily seasonality. Load and demand sequential data are a strong function of calendar facotors like hour and day type. 
Based on a famous proceeding with more than forty citations in patents, I developed this heriarchical clustering algorithm as a tool to identify the most relevant daily patterns, e.g., weekends, holidays, workdays and anomalous profiles.

# Data Visualisation
## Interactive Dashboards
### [Using Tableau for IoT-Dashboard and Energy Management](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/iosb.mrd/viz/DynOpt-En-DemoLoerrach/Monitoring){target="_blank"}

I designed these IoT-Dashboards with monitoring and BI purposes using *Tableau Desktop*. I also developed the whole E2E pipeline using technolgies like *InfluxDB*, *SQLite*, *Python* and *Tableau Bridge* to keep the dashboards up to date on a half-hour basis.
This was the final part of the project "Energiemanager zur angebots- und bedarfsgerechten Zuschaltung von EnergietrÃ¤gern", [dynOpt-En](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/de/projekte-produkte/dynopt-en.html){target="_blank"}. 

Moreover, I developed the core forecasting algorithm for the predictive control of the energy manager.
