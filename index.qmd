# Hello there

I'm Jorge, and I like espresso brewed with light roast beans. I subscribe to Johnny Cash's definition of paradise:

Professionally, I am an Electrical Engineer passionate about sustainable energy sources. That means uncertainty, risk and probabilities—think weather patterns. Somehow, I've always managed to end up doing what I love the most: the development of data-driven models, whether for providing business intelligence or supporting control systems.

I don't bike, but I live in Karlsruhe. If you want to know how I got into what today is Data Science, click on the *About* tab. If you want to talk about data science, energy systems or coffee instead, just drop me an [email](mailto:jorgethomasm@ieee.org).

Have a nice day or evening.
