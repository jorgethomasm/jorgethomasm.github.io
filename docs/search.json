I subscribe to Johnny Cash’s definition of paradise:\n  – This morning, with her, having coffee.\nProfessionally I am Electrical Engineer fond of sustainable energy sources; that means uncertainty, risk and probabilities, you know weather. Somehow, I’ve always managed to end up doing what I love the most: the development of data-driven models either for providing business intelligence or supporting control systems.\nI don’t bike but I live in Karlsruhe. If you want to know how I got into what today is Data Science click on the About tab. If you want to talk about data science, music or coffee instead, just drop me an email.\nHave a nice day or evening.\nJ. Thomas"

    "text": "My data journey started back in the mids 2000s, working as a Reliability Engineer of Power Systems for the operator of the world’s fourth biggest hydroelectric power plant Guri. The objective was ambitious:\n\nDynamic monitoring of the risk of blackouts with probabilistic KPIs.\n\nAt that time the position Data Scientist didn’t exist, but some books in the realm of Data Mining and Emerging Computing Methods trying to organise and formalise the field. However, the area of Survival Analysis, specifically Reliability and Risk were pretty matured, given their importance for the industry.\nGoing forward with a stochastic thinking in an organisation with a lack of statistical culture and less amounts of data wasn’t easy, relying only on a mixture of internal ERP’s data, world surveys and standards. A continuous push towards a data culture from the management above was key, and it still is!"
