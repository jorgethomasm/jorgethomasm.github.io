# Supervised Learning

## Machine Learning
### [Advanced Regression Techniques with Visual Analytics](https://jorgethomasm.github.io/Ames-house-prices-prediction/HousePrices.html){target="_blank"}
In this classic Kaggle project you will **follow my workflow**, qith tips along the way, developing pipelines on the Extract-Transform-Load phase of the Data Science cycle, as well as a tidy approach on the exploratory data analysis substantialy supported on Visual Analytics.

## Deep Learning
It is known that the most common type of dataset found in the industry is the **tabular** one. In this  regard ML and non-parametric, enssemble methods like XGBOOST are king.

However, for datasets with high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio like image recognition and language translation, DL methods are the best.

# Unsupervised Learning
Discovering patterns in the supplied feature space.

Very often we have to do some ML for ML. Yes, that is performing some auto-labelling or at least identify some possible ones. In this professional problem...
