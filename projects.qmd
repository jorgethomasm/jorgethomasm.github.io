# Data Strategy

## [Delivering an ML/AI strategy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NpMqORh_Y_tXOoqrKukTng7ewtSOAyFB/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102039995413823268978&rtpof=true&sd=true){target="_blank"}

"We have a data lake; what can we do?" I developed this demo project with the objective of thoroughly learning a methodology to assess impactful AI implementations in real business projects (Use Cases). I used tools like ***Storyboards***, ***Prioritisation Grids***, ***5 V's Framework*** and ***Potter's Boxes***, all this within a **ship & iterate** philosophy in order to gather quick feedback.

Follow **my workflow** for a **top 10%** solution for this open Kaggle competition, predicting the house prices in Ames. I'll give you tips along the way, developing pipelines on the ETL phase, as well as a clean presentation on the EDA supported on the best visuals. I used ***R*** with the state-of-the-art ***Tidyverse*** and ***Tidymodels*** metapackages. ***Quarto*** is the publishing system.

## [Forecasting heat demand in buildings](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9144899){target="_blank"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
With today's advances on remote sensing, optimal energy management can be performed in the cloud. This is the maxima of project [dynOpt-En](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/de/projekte-produkte/dynopt-en.html){target="_blank"}, where I developed the two-days-ahead forecasting module for the MPC optimiser. Training a ***Generalised Additive Model*** (GAM) and using the ***Dark Sky API***, free at that time, I manage to retrieve the weather variables from Numeric Weather Prediction models (NWP) needed as features.

<p><small>**Keywords**: Machine Learning, Supervised Learning, Time-Series, Forecasting, GAM.</small></p>

In this project my main task was the hyper-parameters optimisation. Using ***Python's scikit-learn*** and ***TensorFlow*** wrapped in the ***Keras API***, I was able to determine the optimal *batch size* and the *number of units* for the LSTM network.

## [Substation reliability assessment using Monte Carlo methods: Real Case Evaluation](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10679-one-single-component-reliability-monte-carlo-chronological-method){target="_blank"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
With 4.5/5 ‚≠ê review score, the almost 20 years-old ***Matlab*** code, which is a simplified version of the full project, has helped more than 3000 practitioners and students. I used the ***Monte Carlo Chronological Technique*** to simulate an artificial history of failures of the components of power substations, estimating load point **stochastic KPIs** like **Estimated Energy Not Supplied (EENS)** and **Estimated Duration of Load Curtailment (EDLC)**.

In the modern world of sector-coupled utilities, ***time-series*** always have a very strong daily seasonality. Sequential data of demand are a strong function of calendar factors like hour and day type. Based on a proceeding with more than fourty patents, I developed this ***hierarchical clustering*** algorithm as a tool to identify the most relevant daily patterns, e.g., weekends, holidays, workdays and anomalous load profiles.

# Data Visualisation

## [IoT-Dashboards for energy management](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/iosb.mrd/viz/DynOpt-En-DemoLoerrach/Monitoring){target="_blank"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
I designed these IoT-Dashboards with monitoring and BI purposes using ***Tableau Desktop***. I also developed the whole E2E pipeline using technologies like ***InfluxDB***, ***SQLite***, ***Python*** and ***Tableau Bridge*** to keep the dashboards up to date on a half-hour basis. This was the final part of the project [dynOpt-En](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/de/projekte-produkte/dynopt-en.html){target="_blank"}.

In 2019 for the [EffMon](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/en/projects-and-products/effmon-efficient-monitoring.html) project, I developed a set of functions to communicate with Fraunhofer's ***FROST-Server***, an Open Source implementation of the ***OGC SensorThings API***. Using ***Markdown*** publishing technologies, as well as libraries like ***ggplot***, I automatised the entire **KPI** calculations and visualisations for reporting and **management of the entire energy demand** of the Fraunhofer IOSB building in Karlsruhe, including district heating, hot water, cooling tower and power.

# Other Devs

## [Global Forecast System decoder](https://github.com/jorgethomasm/GFS-Decoder){target="_blank"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
I wrote this application in ***.NET C#***. It scraps the ftp-site of NCEP's Global Forecast System, [GFS](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/gfs/) - Numeric Weather Prediction model (NWP). It also decodes (degribs) and disaggregates the weather forecast variables of any configured pair of geographical coordinates.
