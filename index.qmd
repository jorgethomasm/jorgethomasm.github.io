# "Hello there"

Hi, I'm Jorge and I like espresso made with light roast coffee beans. I subscribe to J. Cash's definition of paradise:

*‚ÄúThis morning, with her, having coffee.‚Äù*

Professionally I am an Electrical Engineer fond of sustainable energy sources. Somehow, I've always ended up doing what I love the most: the development of data-driven algorithms either for Control Systems support or providing Business Intelligence.

I live in Karlsruhe.
